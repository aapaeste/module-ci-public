This is a documentation file. It should be copied to the output folder as-is. It has a [module-XXX
URL](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci-public) in it, and since this is a Markdown file, that URL should be
changed to a module-XXX-public URL. However, [this other URL](https://github.com/foo/bar) should remain unchanged.
